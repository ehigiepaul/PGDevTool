**PG Dev Tool** Plugin codename PGMonaco, an integration of monaco code editor and terminal to Pinegrow. Monaco Editor is used in Visual Studio Code and many applications.

This was a feature request I created in the forum to help me stop the software jumping in my development process that ended up to be a personal project for me. 

During the creation I got to hear a lot of users request and tried to implement them and scale from there.

**Available** features for now:

* Integrated Monaco
* Integrated terminal into PG **
* emmet for html and css
* support for html, css, C#, json, razor, php, typescript and javascript enabled (most intellisense are not implemented yet)
* Perfect intellisense for html and css.
* Click on none html files and auto open on editor
* Auto update preview
* go to line in editor - Ctrl + G
* open editor - F7
* open terminal - alt + `
* pop out editor **
* Multiple tabs in editor 
* Single tab for terminal
* All basic monaco editor features available
* and more to come.

>  ** indicates know issues and due to the promise of the release on the 14th of February no time to fix

**Shortcuts**
> Alt + ` *open terminal* 

> F7 *open Monaco editor*

**How to Install**
> Simply download the plugin [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LP6EeR7fGhqaK2Scc5bZQIrrl2uXRkuD/view?usp=sharing)
> Extract it anywhere and Open Pinegrow 
> File > Manage libraries and plugins > load plugin
> Navigate to the extracted file and pick the PGDevTools.js
> add it and you are set and ready to go.

Thanks and stay safe.
